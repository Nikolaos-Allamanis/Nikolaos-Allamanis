- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nikolaos-Allamanis
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related with python3 or C++ (Mostly python though, because my knowledge about C++ is a bit limited)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++
- 💞️ I’m currently NOT looking to collaborate on something, because I am too busy studying
- 📫 How to reach me : You can email me at : nikosallam8@gmail.com
(If you email me keep in mind that I am currently studying and I am very busy. So, there is a pretty good chance you are going to have to wait a few days for my reply.)
